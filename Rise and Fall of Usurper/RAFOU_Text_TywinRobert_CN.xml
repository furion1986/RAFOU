			<Text>Tourneys in Westeros vary according to the region in which the tourney is held, the desires of the hosting lord, and the rules devised by the lord's master of the games. Many forms of competition are known, including jousting (also called the lists), mock battles between teams of knights, archery competitions, or the melee, in which many warriors fight individually in one large battle. Tourneys can be small events focusing on one competition held on a single day, or they can be large events that take several days and may include several different competitions. Jousting is a martial game or hastilude between two horsemen wielding lances with blunted tips, often as part of a tournament. The primary aim was to replicate a clash of heavy cavalry, with each opponent trying hard to strike the opponent while riding towards him at high speed, if possible breaking the lance on the opponent's shield or jousting armour, or unhorsing him. The joust became an iconic characteristic of the knight in Romantic medievalism. The participants experience close to three and a quarter times their body weight in G-forces when the lances collide with their armor.</Text>

			<Text>Though ruthless, Tywin Lannister is an able and shrewd ruler who brought great prosperity during his tenures as the King's Hand. He is especially talented at the raising of funds, leading to a persistent jest that he must "shit gold." The common folk of Lannisport cheered twice as loud for Tywin at the tourney for King Aerys II as they did for their actual king. Even so, Tywin is more respected than loved in the Westerlands and he became despised in King's Landing after his house treacherously sacked the city.</Text>

			<Text>Robert has the classical Baratheon look: black hair and bright blue eyes. His heavy black hair is thick on his chest, and coarse around his sex. He is a very tall man; Eddard Stark estimates his height to be six and a half feet. As a young adult, Robert was a handsome, clean shaven man, with rough and hard hands. He was strong and powerful, and muscled "like a maiden's fantasy". However, after he won the throne, Robert's appearance changed. Due to excessive feasting and drinking, Robert gained a significant amount of weight. In the nine years since Greyjoy's Rebellion, he gained at least eight stone in weight. Now, he is often red-faced from drink, with dark circles underneath his eyes, and walks as if he is half in his cups, while sweating through his silks. In the final years of his life, Robert grew a beard, which people described as a wild, thick and fierce thing, and which served to hide his double chin.</Text>

			<Text>Robert is brave, but headstrong, rash, and impatient. He is proud, and will not likely back down on words spoken in a drunken bravado. As king, Robert is no longer used to someone disagreeing with him, and a good way of ensuring that he’d do something, is telling him that he could not, should not, of must not do something (especially in public). Tyrion Lannister considers Robert to be a great blustering oaf, while Varys describes him as a fool. Cersei Lannister considers Robert to be an ignorant, dumb, slow-witted, drunken brute of a man, who does not have the ruthless streak she believes a king requires. Although several people consider Robert to be brave, Cersei believes him to be a coward. According to Petyr Baelish, Robert is simply very practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.</Text>

			<Text>Robert is as strong as a bull and fearless in battle. He loves the song of swords and considers poison to be a coward’s weapon. As long they are honest and brave, Robert can be merciful towards his enemies. The only exception are the Targaryens; His hatred for them is a madness within him. A peerless warrior in his youth, Robert fought with a spiked iron warhammer, crafted by Donal Noye. In battle, he wore a great antlered helmet, which made him look like a horned god. He prefers melees, in which he can hit people with his hammer, over jousts. Despite the numerous weapons in the royal armory, the only blade Robert uses is a hunting knife he received as a boy from Lord Jon Arryn, his foster father. Although his condition has deteriorated due to his weight gain and frequent drinking, Robert remains a strong man; Jaime Lannister believes that Robert is stronger than him. Robert possesses a powerful battlefield voice.</Text>

His lusts are the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm. As king, Robert is not loath to impose upon the hospitality of his subjects, no matter whether it is voluntarily or forced. At the same time, however, Robert possesses a great, but rather careless, generosity. He is an avid hunter. Some of Robert's favorite songs are "A Cask of Ale", "Fifty-Four Tuns", and "The Bear and the Maiden Fair".</Text>

			<Text>A Sellsword is a mercenary who hires out his services to the highest bidder. Inevitably, this sort of lifestyle involves a great deal of violence and physical exertion. Many sellswords are organized into companies. Some of the sellsword companies are very disciplined (such as the Golden Company), and some are nothing but rabble joined together in search of loot (like the Brave Companions); the Second Sons and the StormcReplaces are in the middle.

			<Text>Although not a requirement for becoming a knight, boys, often nobly born, can serve as pages and later squires. Boys can become pages at several different ages. It appears to be normal to become a page from the ages of six or seven onwards. Robert Arryn was six years old when his father planned on having him become a page, although circumstances were not entirely ordinary. According to Brienne of Tarth, boys near the age of six or seven are pages. Edric Dayne became a page at the age of seven, and the Princess of Dorne suggested taking on Jaime Lannister as a page at that age as well. Tommen Baratheon hid as a page at the age of eight, while Kevan Lannister was made a page at this age. When Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, accepts pages and squires from the free folk, he does not accept any boy younger than eight.</Text>

			<Text>After a several years of serving as a page, a boy can become a squire. However, boys are not required to serve as a page before becoming a squire, and because of that, the range of ages upon which a boy is made a squire range quite widely. While Samwell Tarly was supposed to become a page and cupbearer at the age of ten, multiple boys are known to have been squires by that age or by an even younger age. Examples include Doran Martell, Aegon V Targaryen, Rollam Westerling, and Elmar Frey, who were all already a squire at the age of nine, and Barristan Selmy, and Edric Dayne, made a squire at the age of ten. Some squires choose to never become a knight, and live the rest of their lives as squires. This may be because the individual does not have the inclination to live a knight's martial lifestyle, or does not have the funds to properly equip himself.</Text>

			<Text>Pages and squires train at arms. Squires run errands for their masters, tend to their master's animals, clean his mail, and help him into his armor whenever required. In times of war, they ride beside their masters, assisting them and fighting by their sides. During tourneys, squires will provide their masters with new lances, or with a sword. A boy who is being fostered but who is not training for knighthood (e.g., because he does not follow the Faith of the Seven), can perform the duties of a page and squire without strictly being one.</Text>
