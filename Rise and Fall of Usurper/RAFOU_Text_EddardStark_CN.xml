When he reached the age of sixteen, Eddard was a man grown, and divided his time between Winterfell and the Eyrie. During one of his visits to Winterfell, Eddard carried a wedding proposal from Robert to his father, Lord Rickard, who agreed to betroth his daughter Lyanna to Eddard's friend. When Lyanna later expressed that her believe that Robert would never keep to one bed, having heard about Robert's bastard daughter in the Vale, Eddard recalled having seen the child, and is unable to deny her existence.</Text>

Aerys's next step was to demand that Jon Arryn send him the heads of his former wards, Eddard and Robert. Jon refused and instead called his banners.</Text>

The double wedding bound House Tully to the rebels' cause. During his marriage to Catelyn, he had five children with her: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon.</Text>

They were eventually included within the domain of the Kings of Winter from House Stark of Winterfell. The clans have often quarreled with each other, leading the Starks to settle the disputes by force or by calling the chiefs to Winterfell. These feuds are recalled in songs, such as "Black Pines" and "Wolves in the Hills". The clans' territory has also been historically raided by wildlings and ironborn.
