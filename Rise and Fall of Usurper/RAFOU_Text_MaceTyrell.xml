			<Text>The Reach is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms on the continent of Westeros. It was formerly a sovereign nation ruled by the Kings of the Reach before the War of Conquest. It is the second-largest of the kingdoms behind the north and is considered the most fertile and heavily-populated part of Westeros.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_THE_REACH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Reach is considered the home of chivalry in Westeros. It is the place where knighthood is looked upon with the greatest reverence and esteemed the most. It is also the place where the rules to tournaments are the most stringent and managed.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_THE_REACH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">

The Sunset Sea is found to the west, while the hills of the westerlands are to the northwest and the Blackwater Rush of the riverlands is to the north. The Reach borders the crownlands to the northeast, while to the east and southeast are the stormlands and their Dornish Marches. South of the Reach are the Red Mountains of Dorne and the Summer Sea. The Roseroad links Oldtown with King's Landing by way of Highgarden, while the Ocean Road links Highgarden with Lannisport.</Text>

Woodharps made in Oldtown are highly sought after.</Text>

			<Text>Mace is a handsome and once-powerful-looking man who has since turned to fat. He has curly brown hair and cuts his beard, which has white and grey specks in it, into a triangular shape. He is often red-faced. Cersei Lannister thinks of Mace as the same age as her father, Lord Tywin Lannister, although Mace is closer in age to her than to Tywin.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_MACE_TYRELL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Mace has a generally jovial personality. He thinks himself a great warrior, although his reputation rests solely on the victory over Robert I Baratheon in the Battle of Ashford during Robert's Rebellion, which had largely been won by Mace's bannerman, Lord Randyll Tarly, before Mace even arrived at the battlefield, and the command Mace held during the siege of Storm's End later that war, which ended when Mace dipped his banners to Lord Eddard Stark. Mace is ambitious, wishing to see a grandchild of his on the Iron Throne. Despite that, his mother, Lady Olenna Tyrell, can easily hector him, and so influence his decisions. Mace is considered an oaf by his mother and by Cersei Lannister, and a fool by Prince Oberyn Martell and Cersei. His favorite son is Loras, the youngest, and his closest friend is Lord Paxter Redwyne, his brother-in-law. Mace has a great dislike for Dornishmen, especially Prince Oberyn Martell, who accidentally crippled Mace's heir, Willas.</Text>

			<Text>During Robert's Rebellion, Mace was in command of troops from the Reach who marched against Lord Robert Baratheon of Storm's End. Mace is credited with defeating Robert in the Battle of Ashford, although the van under Lord Randyll Tarly achieved most of the victory before Mace's arrival at Ashford. He then led the siege of Storm's End, which was successfully held by Robert's brother, Stannis Baratheon. Mace and his closest bannerman, Lord Paxter Redwyne, surrendered to Robert's ally, Lord Eddard Stark, after the Sack of King's Landing.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_MACE_TYRELL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>According to Oberyn Martell, Mace encouraged his heir, Willas Tyrell, to participate in tourneys before he was ready, leading to the accidental crippling of Willas by Oberyn. Some of the Iron Throne's debts under the new king, Robert I Baratheon, are owed to Lord Mace.</Text>

The Redwynes have one of the three most powerful fleets of the Seven Kingdoms, the others being the Iron Fleet of the Iron Islands and the royal fleet of the Iron Throne. It is the largest fleet in Westeros. Lord Paxter Redwyne owns two hundred warships, while also serving the Redwynes are five times as many merchant carracks, wine cogs, trading galleys, and whalers. Paxter's galleas is the Arbor Queen.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_REDWYNE_FLEET_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>During the Andal invasion of Westeros, the Andals were prevented from landing in the Reach by the fleets of the Redwynes of the Arbor and the Hightowers of Oldtown. Redwyne galleys blockaded Storm's End during Robert's Rebellion. The smuggler Davos evaded the cordon, however, and delivered onions and salt fish to Stannis Baratheon and his starving garrison within the castle. During Greyjoy's Rebellion, warships from the Arbor served under Stannis when he smashed the Iron Fleet in the sea battle off Fair Isle.</Text>
