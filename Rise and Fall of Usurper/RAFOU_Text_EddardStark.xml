			<Text>A godswood is usually a small wooded area within the walls of castles throughout the Seven Kingdoms. It is primarily used as a place of worship by those who carry on the traditions of the First Men and pray to the old gods. To followers of the Faith of the Seven, some of whom belong to families that converted to the Faith throughout the centuries, they are treated as a private wooded area of solitude.</Text>

			<Text>The north or the North is one of the constituent regions of Westeros and was a sovereign nation ruled by Kings in the North before Aegon's Conquest. The largest region of the Seven Kingdoms, the dominion of House Stark extends from the border of the New Gift, which is controlled by the Night's Watch, to the southern edge of the Neck far to the south.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_THE_NORTH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The north has been ruled by the Starks for thousands of years from the castle known as Winterfell. Notable bannermen of the region include Bolton, Cerwyn, Dustin, Flint, Glover, Hornwood, Karstark, Manderly, Mormont, Reed, Ryswell, Tallhart, and Umber. Bastards of noble origin raised in the north are given the surname Snow.</Text>

			<Text>The vast wolfswood, the largest forest of the Seven Kingdoms, extends northwest to the Bay of Ice and Sea Dragon Point. Deepwood Motte, the seat of House Glover, lies in the western wolfswood. House Mormont rules Bear Island in the Bay of Ice. The northern mountains extend from the wolfswood to the Wall and are inhabited by northern mountain clans.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_THE_NORTH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>South of the wolfswood is hilly terrain with several large lakes. Torrhen's Square, seat of House Tallhart, is located by the largest of these lakes. Farther west along the Sunset Sea is the Stony Shore, which contains fishing villages. Southeast of the Stony Shore and north of Blazewater Bay is the Rills, plains which are ruled by House Ryswell. East of the Rills and south of Winterfell are the barrowlands, hilly plains dotted with the barrows of the First Men. House Dustin rules the large town of Barrowton. There are unnamed rivers which flow south from Barrowton and near Torrhen's Square into the Saltspear, while another unnamed river divides the Stony Shore from the Rills.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_THE_NORTH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>South of the barrowlands is the Neck, an isthmus forming the border with the riverlands to the south. A vast swamp and the source of the Green Fork, the Neck is home to the crannogmen; House Reed rules from the moving castle Greywater Watch. The ruined castle of Moat Cailin, located on the causeway near the Fever River, controls access to the north from the Neck. It is here the Kings in the North held off southron invasions.</Text>

South of the peninsula are Ironman's Bay and the Iron Islands.</Text>

			<Text>East of the barrowlands is the White Knife, a major river of the north which has its source at Long Lake northeast of Winterfell. Castle Cerwyn, the seat of House Cerwyn, is located near a tributary south of Winterfell. The White Knife runs south to White Harbor, one of the major cities of the Seven Kingdoms and the main port of the north. Southeast of White Harbor is Oldcastle, the seat of House Locke, while farther east are Ramsgate and the Broken Branch, which has its source in the Sheepshead Hills northeast of White Harbor. Widow's Watch, the castle of House Flint of Widow's Watch, is built on an isolated peninsula east of Ramsgate in the Shivering Sea. The Bite separates the southeastern North, much of which is influenced by House Manderly of White Harbor, from the Vale of Arryn.</Text>

The Dreadfort lies near the Weeping Water, which flows east to the Shivering Sea. Northeast of the Dreadfort are the forested lands of House Karstark. East of their castle, Karhold, are the Grey Cliffs. Located in the Bay of Seals are several islands, including Skagos and uninhabited Skane. The largest, Skagos, is said to be inhabited by cannibals and unicorns and is only nominally controlled by the Starks of Winterfell.</Text>

			<Text>Eddard Stark, also called "Ned", is the head of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. He is a close friend to King Robert I Baratheon, with whom he was raised.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_EDDARD_STARK_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>Eddard was fostered by Lord Jon Arryn at the Eyrie from the age of eight. There, Eddard befriended his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon, while Lord Jon became like a second father to him. When he reached the age of sixteen, Eddard was a man grown, and divided his time between Winterfell and the Eyrie. During one of his visits to Winterfell, Eddard carried a wedding proposal from Robert to his father, Lord Rickard, who agreed to betroth his daughter Lyanna to Eddard's friend. When Lyanna later expressed that her believe that Robert would never keep to one bed, having heard about Robert's bastard daughter in the Vale, Eddard recalled having seen the child, and is unable to deny her existence.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_EDDARD_STARK_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>In 282 AC, Eddard's sister Lyanna was allegedly abducted by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. Eddard's brother Brandon rode to King's Landing in anger, but when he threatened the crown prince, he was arrested. Lord Rickard Stark was summoned to King's Landing, and when he demanded a trial by combat, both he and Brandon were executed at the command of King Aerys II Targaryen. Aerys's next step was to demand that Jon Arryn send him the heads of his former wards, Eddard and Robert. Jon refused and instead called his banners.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_EDDARD_STARK_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>With his father and brother dead, Eddard was now the Lord of Winterfell. Eddard called his banners, and marched south to join Robert and Jon, arriving in time to turn the tide at the Battle of the Bells. Afterward, he went to Riverrun to marry Catelyn Tully, who had been betrothed to his brother Brandon before his death. Jon Arryn married Catelyn's sister Lysa in the same ceremony. The double wedding bound House Tully to the rebels' cause. During his marriage to Catelyn, he had five children with her: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon.</Text>

			<Text>The mountain clans or hill clans are groups of northmen who dwell in the mountains north of Winterfell and in their foothills along the shore of the Bay of Ice. Generally considered petty lords, they should not be confused with the mountain clans of the Vale of Arryn, who are oft considered savages.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_MOUNTAIN_CLAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Of First Men origin, the clansmen have inhabited the mountains north of the wolfswood for thousands of years. They were eventually included within the domain of the Kings of Winter from House Stark of Winterfell. The clans have often quarreled with each other, leading the Starks to settle the disputes by force or by calling the chiefs to Winterfell. These feuds are recalled in songs, such as "Black Pines" and "Wolves in the Hills". The clans' territory has also been historically raided by wildlings and ironborn. The clans have not been visited by a king in centuries, as Torrhen Stark, King in the North, knelt to Aegon I Targaryen during Aegon's Conquest.</Text>
